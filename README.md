### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've started my career in the Tech industry as a QA Engineer at Applause and progressed to a QA Team Lead, where I organized and accomplished multiple full-cycle projects with leading Seattle-based IT companies. I am currently working towards becoming a full stack software developer, learning languages including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, And React. After graduation in July, 2022 I would love to become a SDE at one of the Seattle IT companies and grow professionally.
